C. Detailed Style Guide:

Action: We will define the following:

Fonts: We will use Roboto for all text on our website (as seen in our previous project)

Color Palette: We will use the colors you provided earlier: #384B68, #79A2D1, #9ccef5 and #ffed59 - #FF914D.

The dark blues will be for headers, and dark text.

The light blues will be used for background and cards.

The orange gradients will be for call to action buttons.

The whites will be for text on dark background.

Spacing Guidelines: We will use:

1rem for base padding

2rem for larger padding,

5px to 20px for margins between images in the image grid

Implementation: These will be used to ensure a more cohesive and consistent design.
